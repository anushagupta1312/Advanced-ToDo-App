* Why are there so many apps for a task that's easily done on sticky notes? <br/>
* Because managing tasks is an intensely personal thing. People will reject anything that doesn't feel right. That's a good instinct, but it makes it hard to find the right app.<br/>
* Try <b>MADE SIMPLE</b> where you can set the priorities of the tasks that you need to do.<br/>
* Not only this, you can edit the tasks, sort them according to their priorities, change the priorities, edit the task as well as delete the tasks.<br/>
* Also these tasks can be saved on your local storage so that whenever you open <b>MADE SIMPLE</b> your tasks are intact.<br/>
* Have a look at the demo to learn more.
